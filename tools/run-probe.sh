# WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT A STEP. There are five probes now and each
# needs the same three things: a watchdog, because a program that does not
# return is as much a failure as one that returns wrongly and the job would
# otherwise spend its whole timeout finding out; a report of where a program
# that stopped was, because "exit code 139" answers nothing; and BOTH readings
# of the output, because asserting only that the program reported would pass for
# a program that printed its failures.
#
# Four copies of that would be four places for one of them to fall behind. The
# same reasoning is already written into openkal-llvm-runtime/tools.
