/* Where a C library keeps the state that belongs to one execution context.
 *
 * musl reaches its per-context state --- its error value, its locale, its
 * cancellation state --- through one pointer, and on the systems it was written
 * for that pointer is in a register the architecture reserves. openkal declines
 * to own that register: the convention belongs to openarch, and an operation
 * here that installed a thread pointer would put a processor's calling
 * convention into an interface written to be independent of one.
 *
 * The obvious substitute is a variable declared thread_local, and openkal even
 * reports whether a started context observes one --- KAL_TASK_PROP_THREAD_LOCAL,
 * clause 7.10. This port does not use it, and the reason is worth recording
 * because it was found by running rather than by reading.
 *
 * On one of the three toolchains this package is built by, a thread_local
 * variable is not reached through an address the processor supplies. It is
 * reached through a helper the compiler emits a call to, and that helper
 * allocates the storage on first use --- it calls malloc. malloc is this
 * library's. This library's malloc touches its error value. Its error value is
 * per-context state, reached through the thread pointer, reached through the
 * helper, which allocates.
 *
 * The recursion is unbounded, it appears only at run time as a program that
 * starts and never returns, and neither side of it reads as though anything is
 * wrong. A C library cannot keep the state it needs in order to allocate in a
 * place that must be allocated.
 *
 * So the state is kept here, keyed on the identity openkal already gives every
 * context. The cost is a lookup where a load would have done; the benefit is
 * that this port depends on nothing beyond openkal --- it runs above an
 * implementation whose contexts have no thread-local storage at all, which is
 * an arrangement clause 7.10 explicitly permits.
