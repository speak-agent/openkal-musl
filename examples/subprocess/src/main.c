/* Another program, started several ways, by a program that names no openkal
 * symbol.
 *
 *   fork          duplicating the calling image --- `openkal.space'
 *   posix_spawn   starting a named program --- `openkal.process'
 *   execve        the same, expressed as replacing this image
 *   system        a command line handed to a shell
 *   popen         the same, with a channel back
 *
 * TWO OF THE FIRST THREE ALREADY WORKED AND NOTHING SAID SO. This package
 * replaces musl's `posix_spawn' with port/src/okm_spawn.c, and `system' and
 * `popen' are both written on `posix_spawn' --- so they have been available for
 * as long as that file has, and no test in this repository ever ran one. A
 * capability that works and is not asserted is a capability that will stop
 * working quietly.
 *
 * AND THAT IS EXACTLY HOW THE REDIRECTION DEFECT SURVIVED. Every
 * observation here reported that a program STARTED. None of them asked WHERE ITS
 * OUTPUT WENT, and the answer was: to the stream this program was started with,
 * whatever the caller had redirected onto. `popen' passed throughout, because
 * musl builds it on an explicit `adddup2' and that branch was translated;
 * `system', `posix_spawn' and `execve' all lost the redirection. Reported by a
 * consumer as openkal-linux#13, not here, and the whole reason it was not here
 * is the shape of the question this file used to ask.
 *
 * THE PROGRAM THAT IS STARTED IS THIS ONE, WITH A MODE ON ITS COMMAND LINE.
 * A probe that started `/bin/sh' would be a probe that only two of the four
 * systems can run, and the redirection criteria hold on all four.
 *
 * WHAT IS EXPECTED IS STATED ON THE COMMAND LINE RATHER THAN INFERRED, which
 * is the same arrangement examples/net uses and for the same reason. An
 * environment whose backend declines `openkal.space' is not a failure; an
 * environment that was expected to provide it and quietly does not IS one, and
 * a probe that accepted either answer could not tell them apart.
 *
 *   --fork | --no-fork     whether the calling image can be duplicated
 *   --shell | --no-shell   whether this system has a shell at /bin/sh
 *
 *   --abort-signal | --abort-status | --abort-terminated
 *                          how the implementation beneath expresses a program
 *                          that ended abnormally.
 *
 * THREE VALUES AND NOT TWO, BECAUSE A CRITERION WHOSE ANSWER IS "SOMETHING
 * UNUSUAL HAPPENED" HOLDS FOR THE DEFECT AS WELL AS FOR THE FIX.
 *
 * Before `abort' reached `kal_abort' it fell through to musl's `a_crash()' and
 * the program died on a fault --- which is also distinguishable from an
 * ordinary end, so the portable observation below passes either way and proves
 * nothing on its own. What discriminates is the PARTICULAR end each
 * implementation produces:
 *
 *     --abort-signal      SIGABRT.  openkal-linux's kal_abort is tgkill(SIGABRT)
 *     --abort-status      exit 134. openkal-macos ends with a status no program
 *                                   returns
 *     --abort-terminated  a signal, any signal, and not a fault. On Windows
 *                                   kal_abort fail-fasts and kal_process_wait
 *                                   reports that as a termination; the fault
 *                                   this replaces was reported as an exit
 *
 * So each row asserts what ITS backend does, and each of the three fails on the
 * defect. openkal permits implementations to differ here and the criterion has
 * to differ with them rather than settle for what all three happen to share.
