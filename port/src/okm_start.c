/* Startup, and the thread pointer.
 *
 * Two of musl's own sources are replaced rather than redirected, and both for
 * the same reason: they are the two places where musl reads the shape of the
 * environment directly instead of asking the kernel for something.
 *
 *   src/env/__libc_start_main.c reads the auxiliary vector, which is a table
 *   the Linux kernel leaves above the environment strings on the initial
 *   stack. No other environment has one, and openkal supplies what the vector
 *   carried --- the arguments, the named values --- through openkal.env.
 *
 *   src/env/__init_tls.c reads the program's own ELF headers in order to build
 *   the thread-local storage image. openkal reports, through kal_task_props,
 *   that a started context already observes the toolchain's thread-local
 *   storage, so there is no image for this layer to build: musl needs one slot
 *   in it, and that slot is __okm_tp.
 *
 * Everything else musl does at startup is unchanged and runs from here.

 *
 * Mach-O INVERTS IT. The dynamic loader runs an image's constructors BEFORE
 * transferring control to its entry point, so a C++ runtime's static
 * initialisers execute while this library has not been initialised at all.
 * Measured 2026-08-23, an arm64 image built on Linux and run on a real Mac:
 *
 *     dyld: running initializer 0x…f3aa48 in openkal-same-source
 *       _GLOBAL__I_000100 → std::ios_base::Init::Init()
 *         → DoIOSInit::DoIOSInit()

 *             → __stdinbuf<char>::__stdinbuf(FILE*, mbstate_t*)   ← EXC_BAD_ACCESS
 *
 * libc++ constructs its standard streams over this library's `stdin`, and at
 * that moment `okm_start` has not run.
 *
 * ⇒ So the bringing-up is a function of its own with a once guard, and the
 * platform that needs it earlier calls it earlier (`port/src/mach/`). Calling
 * it twice is not a hazard; calling it late is.
 *
 * NOT A LOCK. This runs before the thread layer exists — `__init_tls` is one
 * of the things it does — so a mutex here would be using what it is installing.
 * A plain flag is correct because there is exactly one execution context at
 * this point on every format: the loader has not started any, and neither have
