#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Reproduces the two measurements musl/PATCHES.md records for the other system,
# from a machine that is not one.
#
# It answers two questions, and it is written so that either can fail:
#
#   1. How many indirect symbols does a complete build produce? The number
#      recorded is zero; a build that produces any is a build this probe should
#      report, because the linker that would refuse them is still in use.
#
#   2. Which names does that system supply TO THIS PORT'S OWN CODE? The number
#      recorded is two, and they are listed. A third would mean this port has
#      acquired a dependency on that system that nobody decided to acquire.
#
#      That is not the same as the set the LINK needs. `dyld_stub_binder' is
#      referenced by the linker for its own lazy binding and by no source here,
#      and whether it is referenced at all depends on the linker's version:
#      ld64.lld 22 does not, ld64.lld 18 does. So the enumeration below asks
#      what the port calls, and the link below asks whether the stub is
#      sufficient --- two questions, and answering the first does not answer the
#      second. Measured 2026-08-22, when the first was taken for the second and
#      continuous integration disagreed with the machine it was written on.
#
# The second question is asked of the LINKER rather than of the sources. A
# reading of the sources produces a false positive --- a name referenced by a
# source the configured build excludes --- and the linker does not.
#
# Requires: clang, llvm-nm, and ld64.lld. Nothing from the other system.
