# a different and weaker claim, and is the one that holds after a release.

# The manifest names the implementation by a path already, and that is not a

# The working trees are modified in place. That is intended: this runs in

# AND WHAT WAS FETCHED HAS TO BE WHAT THE MANIFEST ASKED FOR.
#
# Substituting a working tree for a version removes the one check that would
# otherwise happen: the resolver never sees a version requirement, so a tree of
# any age satisfies it. `fetch` above falls back to the default branch when a
# repository has no branch of this name, which is right — most branches here
# have no counterpart — but it means a change that spans two repositories is
# built against whichever half happens to be on `main`.
#
# THAT FALLBACK ONCE PRODUCED A FAILURE THAT NAMED THE WRONG THING. This
# package's branch was `feat/getrandom-through-openkal` while the
# specification's was `feat/openkal-random`, so the fallback supplied openkal
# 0.6.0 to a manifest asking for 0.7.0, and five jobs reported:
#
#     port/src/okm_syscall.c:27:10: fatal error: 'openkal/random.h' file not found
#
# A missing header reads as a mistake in this package. The mistake was that the
# two halves were not in step, which is what this says instead. A hard failure
# is also the only safe answer: had the specification's change been additive,
# the same mismatch would have passed while testing the wrong specification.
