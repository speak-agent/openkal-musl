/* Starting another program.
 *
 * The second of musl's own sources this port replaces, and the reason is the
 * same shape as the first. musl starts a program by duplicating itself and
 * then replacing the duplicate: `posix_spawn' calls clone with CLONE_VFORK and
 * the duplicate calls execve. openkal has neither operation, and clause 7.1 of
 * the specification records why: duplicating an address space and its
 * execution state cannot be performed faithfully on every environment openkal
 * targets, so an implementation obliged to reproduce it would be building a
 * compatibility layer.
 *
 * What openkal has instead is the composite: kal_process_spawn starts a named
 * program with an argument vector, a set of named values and a choice of
 * streams. That is what `posix_spawn' means, so the replacement is a
 * translation of arguments rather than a reconstruction of a mechanism --- and
 * it is shorter than the code it replaces.
 *
 * What is lost is the part of `posix_spawn' that is expressed as instructions
 * for the duplicate to perform: an arbitrary sequence of file actions. Four of
 * the five are expressible in what openkal offers and are translated; the fifth
 * is refused rather than ignored.
 *
 * --- what the started program's three streams are -------------------------
 *
 * THIS FILE USED TO PASS `{0, 0, 0}' AND LET THE FILE ACTIONS OVERWRITE IT,
 * WHICH LOST EVERY REDIRECTION A CALLER HAD ALREADY PERFORMED.
 *
 * openkal spells "the stream its parent has" as a handle of zero (process.h),
 * and an implementation reads that as the descriptor the CALLING IMAGE holds ---
 * not the one this library's table holds. `dup2' rebinds this table and issues
 * no system call, because there is none to issue: openkal has no operation that
 * replaces one of a running program's own streams. So after
 *
 *     dup2(fd, 1);  posix_spawn(…)         or        dup2(fd, 1);  execve(…)
 *
 * the started program wrote to the stream this program was STARTED with, and the
 * file the caller had redirected onto stayed empty. Reported as
 * openkal-linux#13; measured by a consumer, not here, because the probe in
 * examples/subprocess started programs and never redirected first.
 *
 * THE ATOM WAS ALREADY PRESENT. `kal_fs_stream' is a required operation of
 * `openkal.fs' and this port has stored its result in every file description
 * since okm_syscall.c opened one. What was missing was the route from the table
 * to the spawn, which is the same shape as the defect that report began with.
 *
 * AND ZERO IS STILL PASSED WHERE NOTHING WAS REDIRECTED, WHICH IS LOAD-BEARING.
 * `KAL_PROCESS_PROP_STREAM_PASSING' exists because an environment may be able to
 * start a program that inherits and unable to place a stream of the caller's
 * choosing. Seeding with zero for an untouched descriptor asks for that capability
 * only when a caller has actually asked for something, so a backend without it
 * still runs every program that does not redirect.

/* --- can this name be started at all? --------------------------------------
 *
 * ASKED HERE BECAUSE THE ANSWER DOES NOT COME BACK FROM BENEATH, AND A
 * CALLER OF `execvp' CANNOT PROCEED WITHOUT IT.
 *
 * An implementation starts a program by duplicating itself and replacing the
 * duplicate, and the replacement happens in the DUPLICATE --- so a name that
 * cannot be started is discovered by a program that is no longer this one.
 * openkal-linux ends that duplicate with 127 (`process.cpp'), and its
 * `kal_process_spawn' returns `kal_ok' with a handle: the failure is reported
 * to nobody.
 *
 * ⇒ `execve' then waited for the duplicate, read 127, and ENDED THE CALLING
 * PROGRAM with it. musl's `execvp' issues one `execve' per PATH entry and
 * relies on it RETURNING with errno set so it can try the next one, so the
 * search could not survive its first miss: a program named without a slash was
 * found only when it happened to sit in the first entry. Reported as
 * openkal-linux#13 and measured by a consumer, who also measured that
 * `bwrap' --- present at /usr/bin/bwrap --- was reported as not installed.
 *
 * THE ENQUIRY IS ALREADY REQUIRED OF EVERY IMPLEMENTATION. `kal_fs_info' is
 * an operation of `openkal.fs' and this file already resolves the name through
 * `okm_resolve'; asking what the name refers to is one more call on a path that
 * is about to start a program anyway.
 *
 * AND IT ANSWERS TWO OF THE THREE QUESTIONS, WHICH IS WHY A3 IS STILL OPEN.
 * `ENOENT' and `ENOTDIR' are what a PATH search needs and are what this
 * settles. Whether an existing file may be EXECUTED is not something openkal
 * reports --- `kal_node_info' carries `writable' and no other permission --- so
 * a name that exists and cannot be run still ends the caller with 127. That
 * residue is recorded in README.md beside `access(X_OK)', which cannot answer
 * it either and for the same reason. The complete answer needs the backend to
 * report its own failure; asked for at openkal-linux. */

/* Places one stream, and answers with an error value where the interface has no
 * way to say what the caller asked for.
 *
 * `placed' records whether anything the environment must be ABLE to place has
 * been placed. A caller that duplicates descriptor 1 onto position 1 when
 * descriptor 1 has not moved has asked for inheritance, so that case is
 * normalised back to zero: asking a backend for a capability it does not need
 * would refuse a spawn that can be performed.
 *
 * AND ZERO IS BOTH A SENTINEL AND A VALID HANDLE, WHICH IS NOT THIS FILE'S
 * DOING AND IS THIS FILE'S PROBLEM.
 *
 * `kal_spawn_streams' spells inheritance as a handle of zero. `kal_stream' has
 * no reserved value, and openkal-linux answers `kal_stdin()' with zero because
 * its streams are the environment's own descriptors. The two are consistent for
 * position zero --- placing standard input at standard input and inheriting it
 * are the same act --- and inexpressible for the one case where they differ: a
 * caller that redirects its OUTPUT onto its own standard input, which reaches
 * here as the handle zero at position one.
 *
 * ⇒ Refused, rather than passed on. Passing it on would be read as inheritance
 * and would start the program writing to the stream the caller had just
 * redirected away from --- the silent wrong answer this whole change exists to
 * remove. A refusal is one the caller can act upon. Recorded in
 * musl/PATCHES.md, and reported upstream: the specification reserves a value in

/* --- starting a program named without a path -------------------------------
 *
 * The third of musl's own sources this port replaces, and it is replaced
 * because the second one was.
 *
 * musl does not search a PATH here. It stores `__execvpe' in the attributes and
 * lets its `posix_spawn' call that IN THE DUPLICATE instead of `execve', so the
 * search happens inside a program that has already been started. This port has
 * no duplicate to run it in --- `__posix_spawn' translates a spawn into
 * `kal_process_spawn' --- so the field was read by nobody and the name was
 * taken as a path relative to the working directory. `posix_spawnp("sh", …)'
 * started `./sh', which is not there, and reported SUCCESS.
 *
 * ⇒ The search is performed here, one `__posix_spawn' per entry, which is the
 * arrangement musl's own `__execvpe' uses one `execve' per entry for. It works
 * for the same reason that one now works: `__posix_spawn' reports a name it
 * cannot start rather than starting something that ends with 127.
 *
 * The rules are musl's, so that a program moved onto this port meets the answer
 * it met before: a name containing a separator is not searched for; an empty
 * entry means the working directory; `EACCES' anywhere is remembered and
 * reported only if nothing is found; and any other error ends the search at
 * once, because it is not evidence about the next entry.
 *
 * INCLUDING THE ENTRY SEPARATOR, WHICH IS A COLON ON EVERY TARGET AND IS THE
 * WRONG ONE FOR EXACTLY ONE OF THEM.
 *
 * One environment separates its own PATH with a semicolon and begins each entry
 * with a volume letter and a colon, so a colon-separated reading of its PATH
 * produces entries that are not names. The reason it is still a colon here is
 * that `execvp' --- which this port does NOT replace, and which reaches
 * `execve' --- splits on a colon in musl's own source. Splitting differently in
 * this function would make the two ways of searching for one program disagree
 * with each other, which is a worse thing for a caller to meet than one that is
 * wrong in a way both share. Recorded in musl/PATCHES.md; the CI row for that
 * environment declares no shell, so nothing there searches a PATH today. */
